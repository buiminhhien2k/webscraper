# webscraper
This webscraper was created to collect data about catering companies in North Brabant from dnb.com website. I created it for the project with HLB Van daal in my exchange semester

## What I learned:
I learn about Xpath and BeautifulSoup to crawl information from the website and structure them to the dataset.
